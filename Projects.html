                    <h4 id="projectHeaders">This Website!</h4>
                    <p>This project was a lot of fun. Because I cannot upload the code of the websites that 
                        I have coded professionally, I created this website as proof of my 
                        frontend development ability. Additionally I use it as an extension of my resume
                        and to show potential employers a bit about who I am. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The base text and HTML formatting was a tad mundane, 
                        but playing with the combination HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was great. The part I am 
                        most proud of is the interactive text bubble containers on the about page. Those 
                        required a lot of JavaScript and seemingly endless CSS editing. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Additional fun little projects I added to the website include the Night / Day button
                        on the top-left, the pop up text / accordion style text boxes that you are currently 
                        reading from, the cute jumping and color transitioning text on the about page, and the 
                        cool button variety on the contact page.

                    <h4 id="projectHeaders">Zillow Scraper</h4>
                    <p>I created this program for fun because I was spending hours on Zillow trying to find
                        houses worth looking at. Unfortunately, I do not have unlimited money to obtain unlimited
                        API calls so the program is not particularly useful to me in all honesty. However, it
                        was excellent practice that led to my next project.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I only added 3 variables to the cross-search, but it would be simple as the structure and 
                        more complex pieces are already completed. The three variables were total cost, 
                        area, and square footage. I had planned to cross reference with data showing area with Y-o-Y % increase
                        per county as well as more detailed maps to only display properties in areas with marginal 
                        potential growth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have not uploaded this program to my GitHub account yet, but only because my
                        personal info and personal API key are imbedded into the program and I would have to 
                        separate those as variables or something. I suppose I should just to add to my
                        portfolio, but the code itself isn't practical enough for use (without buying API calls).

                    <h4 id="projectHeaders">Creatine Price Tracker</h4>
                    <p>This project is probably the one I use the most frequently. I'm an amateur bodybuilder so I buy
                        a lot of creatine and protein supplements. I figured I could build something to save myself a 
                        bit of money. I had to get a few API keys to use multiple websites, but because I only buy 
                        supplements every few months and I don't need to make many API calls, the program is still 
                        plenty practical.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The program isn't particularly complex. I used python and the classical BeautifulSoup
                        to scrape multiple websites and output just the title and price of a few particular 
                        products that I prefer. The most complex part was just coordinating multiple API keys for 
                        multiple sites.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the future, I plan to implement this program into a website. If completed, I can use this
                        program on any device and also let others use it as well.
